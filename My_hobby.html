                    My father has had plants on the balcony since I was a child, so I also like to grow some flowers and plants.

                    The prototype of this Building Blocks Set is a Ford-class nuclear-powered aircraft carrier, 
                    which is about 2,200 blocks. I used four days of spare time to complete it. 
                    Only the radar and elevator on the command tower can be moved. No other parts can be moved.

                I remember this building blocks set was also around 2,000 blocks, but it has a lot of movable parts. 
                The hood, trunk, four doors, steering wheel and the machine gun on the roof are all movable.  
                And you can see the details of the engine compartment when the hood is opened.

                    This is my favorite one, it has 2530 pieces. Its prototype is the German tank Leopard 2A7V. Because I usually like to play some war-type games, 
                    I like modern weapons very much (in fact, I think World War II weapons are better looking)
